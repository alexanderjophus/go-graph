A small graph library to recreate my final year project written in Go!

This library is very much still experimental. Error handling will be implemented at a later date (though it really shouldn't be).

Using Benchmark tests for testing performance.

## Usage

```sh
go run example/main.go DQc
```

Where `DQc` is the g6 representation of the graph you want to find MIS for.
